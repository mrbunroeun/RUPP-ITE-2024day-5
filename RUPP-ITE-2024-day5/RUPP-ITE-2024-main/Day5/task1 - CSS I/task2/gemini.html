1 Inline CSS
Placement: Directly within the HTML element using the style attribute.
Example: <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a paragraph.</p>
Advantages: Quick and easy for styling individual elements.
Disadvantages: Poor maintainability, as styles are scattered throughout the HTML code.
2 Internal CSS
Placement: Within the <head> section of the HTML document, inside a <style> tag.
Advantages: Better organization than inline CSS, suitable for styling multiple elements within the same document.
Disadvantages: Limited reusability, as styles are specific to the current HTML document.
3 External CSS
Placement: In a separate .css file linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Styles</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: green;">Inline CSS</h1>
    <p>This paragraph has internal CSS.</p>
    <h2 id="external-heading">External CSS</h2>
    <p id="external-paragraph">This paragraph also has external CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>

#external-heading {
